2024-06-07 — Added a module-level send_ports_info_to_channel function in core/app_logic.py for import compatibility with main.py.
2024-06-07 — On startup, I now send a ports/services embed to a 'ports' channel under the 'my-pc' category, creating the channel if needed, using the same logic as the logs startup message (core/app_logic.py).
